I developed "Tech Support Hub," a professional and responsive website for an IT support service provider. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a major focus on user experience (UX). I prioritized creating an intuitive, seamless, and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring that users could quickly find the information they need and contact the support team without hassle.

The website highlights key services such as Virus & Malware Removal, Network Setup, Data Backup & Recovery, Hardware Repair, and Cloud Solutions. The clean design features animated transitions, smooth navigation, and structured content sections to provide an engaging and efficient user experience.

By focusing on usability and responsiveness, this project showcases my ability to create user-friendly websites tailored to business needs.
